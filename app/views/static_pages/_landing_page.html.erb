  <h3>How does it work?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Simply search for a book that you either have read, would like to read,
      or are reading, then add it to your library.
    </li>
    <li>
      Once a book is in your library, you can mark it as read, reading, or want
      to read.
    </li>
    <li>
      You can also add notes about each of the books in your library to help
      remember anything you'd like about a particular book!
    </li>
  </ul>

<div class="presenter">
  <h3>Looking to buy a book you want?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Each book in your library contains a link to go straight to the Amazon
      page for that book, so you don't have to waste time searching for it when
      you've decided that it's time to make that purchase!
    </li>
  </ul>
